This is a fork of the https://github.com/go-fsnotify/fsnotify, but with one
important change: when watching a directory, we only watch for newly created
files and NOT modifications to the files within that directory.  This is really
important in the production environment in order to avoid the program from
getting woken up hundreds of times every second with nothing to do.
